## Course Description
Covers software design, implementation, and testing using Python. Introduces object-oriented design techniques. Includes problem solving and debugging skills. Emphasizes the development of secure, well-designed software projects that solve practical, real-world problems. Prerequisites: (CIS 122 or CIS 161A or MUC 282) or instructor permission. 


## Intended Outcomes for the Course
Upon completion of the course students should be able to:

· Use an integrated development environment to write, run, and test simple object-oriented Python programs.
· Read and make elementary modifications to Python programs that solve real-world problems.
· Validate input in a Python program.
· Identify and fix defects and common security issues in code.
· Use a version control system to track source code in a project.
· Adequately document Python programs.

## Course Content (Themes / Issues / Skills)
Students will complete software projects comprised of an object-oriented design, implementation, and test plan.

· Designs will demonstrate the use of good object-oriented design principles.
· The implementation will demonstrate the use of a variety of basic control structures including selection, repetition, and recursion.
· Programs will use appropriate data structures, such as lists, sets, tuples, and dicts.
· Testing will include unit testing, integration, and system testing.
